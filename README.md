# Lmon_QRG; RoVibrational Spectra Calculations of water clusters.
RoVibrational Spectra of water clusters using the Local Monomer Approximation
and Quasi-Regular Grids.

# Current Development:
Begin by developing scaled normal mode coordinates and apply to the morse test case. 

Generalize the code for any d-dimensional system, d1 dimensional monomer, and d2 dimensional subspace.

## Analysis
Various scripts I have generated for studying/analyzing the accuracy of these
methods.

## External Codes
For minimization we have adapted the simplex minimization. 
See the Quasi_Regular_Grids for a monte carlo minimization implementation. 

## References/Context
Add in papers about Local Monomer Approximation.

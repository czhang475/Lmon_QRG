Begin testing normal mode transformations for Lmon calculations
Start with a 3D toy potential for testing.

Grid is generated with QRG code (included here, the same as the QRG repo). 

Current code computes Hessian and associated terms, however, it does not use them.
The code is exactly the same as QRG vibrational analysis and reproduces its 
results exactly.
The computed hessian and forces are correct (consistent with analytic expression).

The next step is to introduce normal modes, everything to this point is working.
